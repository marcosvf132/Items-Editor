# Items-Editor
 DevM Items Editor is a tool that can make server development easier.
 
Offer tools to update and create missing items on your XML by pushing it from client 12 assets and Tibia WIKI.

 This item editor was created to work along with Canary and OpenTibiaBR repository but can work on another servers.
 
  > On different server bases and versions may demand adaptation to work as intended.

# How to use
 - Compile the program with Visual studio or download the compiled release.
 - Open the executable file and click on 'Load XML'.
 - Choose the type of your XML file. (ServerID or ClientID)
 - Edit any item you wan't or click on 'Load assets' to reload and create missing items following the data on your client 12 assets.
 - Update your items data from tibia WIKI. I higly recommend you load the client 12 assets first.
